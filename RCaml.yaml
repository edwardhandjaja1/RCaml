  Our project, RCaml, is an interactive statistical computing environment, bringing core features of the R programming language into OCaml. It supports essential operations for data manipulation, statistical modeling, and a range of built-in statistical functions to simplify common analyses. Users can explore data, run workflows, and interact with data frames and statistical models through a command-line interface.
  
  While primarily text-based, RCaml could extend to include simple data visualizations, like line and bar charts, either displayed directly in the terminal or exported to image files for easy sharing.
